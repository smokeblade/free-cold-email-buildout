This isn\'t about creating perfect documentation—it\'s about understanding what actually happens in your business day-to-day.\n\nStart by identifying the key processes that consume your time. These are typically the tasks that are repetitive, time-consuming, and don\'t require your unique expertise. Common examples include email management, data entry, scheduling, and basic research.\n\nFor each process, document the happy path—the ideal way the task should be completed. Include all inputs, outputs, tools used, and any decision points. Don\'t worry about edge cases initially; focus on getting the core process documented first.\n\nKeep it visual where possible. A simple flowchart or step-by-step list is often more effective than paragraphs of text. The goal is to make it easy for someone else to understand and follow your process.',
